*Numeric Expressions 
 + Addition 
 _ Substraction
 * Multiplication 
 / Division
 ** Power
 % Remainder/Modul
         
     Example 
   >>> jj = 23
   >>> kk = jj % 5
   >>> print(kk)
   3
   >>> print(4 ** 3)
   64

  Numeric Expressions 
*Python understand "operator precedence" - which operator comes first () / * + - ===> Parenthesis, Power , Multiplication , Addition, left to right.
*Python knows the difference between an integer number and a string.
*For example "+" means "addition" if something is a number and "concatenate" if something is a string.
 
 Type conversions. 
*Python knows what "type" everything is. 
*We can ask Python what type something is by using the  type() function.
*when you put and integer and floating point in an expression, the integer is implicityly converted to a float. 
*you can control this with the built-in functions int()  and float() 
    Example 
    >>> print( float(99) + 100)
    199.0
    >>> i = 42
    >>> type(i)
    <class 'int'>
    >>> f = float(i)
    >>> print(f)
    42.0
    >>> type(f)
    <class'float'>
    >>>

  Integer Division 
*Integer division produces a floating point result in 3.0 version of python. 

   User Input 
*We can instruct Python to pause and read data from the user using the input() function.
*The input() function returns a string. 
    Example 
  name = input('who are you? ')
  print('welcome', name)

  Conditional statment
*Python use a tab for show a sub command. this is used in the case of if statmetn. 
    Example 
 x = 5
 if x < 10:
    print('Smaller')
 if x > 20:
    print('Bigger')
 print('Finis)

*operators  <, <=, ==(equal to) , >= ,> ,!= 
*Nested indentation 
    Example 
   x = 4 
   if x < 10 :
     print('true')
       if x > 3 :
          print('true')
   Print('nexted indentation')

*else
  x = 4 
  if x > 2:
    print('Bigger')
  else:
    print('Smaller')
  print('All done')

  conditional multi-way
  Example 
 if x < 2 :
   print('small')
 elif x < 10 :
   print('medium')
 else :
   print('Large')
 print('All done')

  Example
 if x < 2 :
   print('Below 2')
 elif x >= 2 :
   print('Two or more')
 else :
   print('something else')

   #what ever the value of x is the last else statmetn will not run

  Example 
 if x < 2 :
     print('Below 2')
 elif x < 20 :
     print('Below 20')
 elif x < 10 :
     print('Below 10')
 else :
     print('Somthing else')

 #in this condition if x is 6 it will print Below 20 and jump Below 10

try/except structure
* you surround a dangerous section of code with try and except 
* if the code in the try works - the except is skipped
* if the code in the try fails - it jumps to the except section

    Example 
rawstr = input('Enter a number :')
try:
    ival = int(rawstr)
except:
    ival = -1

if ival > 0 :
   print('Nice work')
else :
   print('Not a number')

   Example
astr = 'Hello Bob'
try:
  istr = int(aster)
except:
  inst = -1
print('First', inst)
astr = '123'
try:
  inst = int(astr)
except:
  instr = -1
print('second', instr)   #when the second conversion succeeds - it just skips the except: clause and the program continues.
                         #if you put more than one line of code in try clause and if some issue happend it will jump all lines and execute except: clause and don't come back for the reset of the line.

    Example 
astr = 'Bob'
try:
 print('Hello')
 istr = int(astr)
 print('There')   #because the above line of code do have issue it will stop an go to except: clause and never come back to excute this line.
except:
 istr = -1
print('Done', istr)

  Summary 
-Comparison operators   == <= >= < > ! =
-Indentation 
-One-way Decisions 
-Two-way decisions: if: and else:
-Nested Decissions 
-Multi-way decisions using elif
-try / ecept to compensate for errors

    Chapter 4
    Functions 
*Stored (and reused) steps
   Example 
  def thing() :        #function defind
      print('Hello')
      print('Fun')

  thing()                #function invoced 
  print('Zip')
  thing()                 #reused #the output is like    ----- Hello  Fun   Zip  Hello  Fun


*There are two kinds of functions in Python.
  - Built-in functions that are provided as part of python- print(),input(), type(), float(), int()...
  -Functions that we define ourselves and then use
*We treat the built-in function names as "new" reserved words(i.e. we aovid them as variable name)
*In Python a function is some reusable code that takes arguments(s) as input, does some computation , and then returns a result or results
*We define a function using the def reserved word
*We call/invoke the function by using the function name, parentheses , and arguments in an expression.
*def keyword in Python it indicates the start of function, and the following indented section of code is to be stored for later.
   Example 
big = max('Hello world')     #this is assignmetn statment 
print(big)     #output is w

tiny = min('Hello world')
print(tiny)    #output is space " "

*type conversions 
-when you put an ineger and floating point in an expression, the integer is implicitly converted to a float
-use built - in fucntions int() and float()
  
Example
print float(99) / 100
0.00
i =42
type(i)
'int'

String conversions
*input function returns string. 

   Example
sval = '123'
type(sval)
<class 'str'>
print(sval + 1)    #this will generate an error.


ival = int(sval)
type(ival)
<class 'int'>
print(ival + 1)
124
nav = 'hello bob'
niv = int(nav)    #this will generate an error.

Argument and Parameter
   Example
def greet(lang):         #argument at the same time parameter
    if lang == 'es':
        print('Hola')
    elif lang == 'fr':
        print('Bonjour')
    else:
        print('Hello')
greet('en')     #Hello
greet('es')     #Hola
greet('fr')     #Bonjour

   Return Values
* The return statement ends the function execution and send bank teh result of the function
 Example
 def greet():
    return "Hello"

print(greet(), "Glenn")       # Hello Glenn
print(greet(), "sally")       # Hello Sally

*Return Value
  Example 
def greet(lang):
    if lang == 'es':
       return 'Hola
    elif lang == 'fr':
       return 'Bonjour'
    else:
       return 'Hello'
print(greet('en'), 'Glenn')    #Hello Glenn
print(greet('es'), 'Sally')    #Hola Sally
print(greet('fr'), 'Michael')  #Bonjour Michael

Multiple parameters / Arguments 
   Example
def addtwo(a,b):
    added = a + b
    return added

x = addtwo(3,5)
print(x)      # 8


* when a function does not return a value, we all it a "void" function

-Results (fruitful functions)
-Void (non-fruitful) functions
-why use functions?
-Functions

 Chapter 5
   Loops and Iterations.
while loop
     Example 
n = 5 
while n > 0 :
   print(n)
   n = n - 1 
print('Blastoff')
print(n)

*Loops(repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time through a loop. Often these iteration variables go though a sequence of numbers. 

Breaking out of a loop
*the break statement ends the current loop and jumpls to the statement immediately following the loop
    Example 
while True:
    line = input('>)
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
print('Done')

*Loop Idioms: 
   set some variables to 
      initial values 

  FOR thing IN DATA:
     Look for something or 
     do something to each 
     enty separately
     updating a variable 

 Look at the variables

    Example 
print('Before')
for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15]:
    print(thing)
print('After')

   Example
 Finding the largest value
largest_so_far = -1
print('Before', largest_so_far)
for the_num in [9, 41, 12,3,74,15]
     if the_num > largest_so_far
        largest_so_far = the_num
     print(largest_so_far, the_num)
print('After', largest_so_far)   #Before -1  9 9  41 41   41 12   41 3   74 74   74 15   After 74


  Example 
 Finding the largest value
numbers = [3, 89, 99, 7, 88, 22, 27]
max_number = max(numbers)
print(max_number)

*Counting in a Loop
*To count how many times we execute a loop, we introduce a counter variable that starts at 0 and we add one to it each time though the loop.
   Example
zork = 0
print('Before', zork)
for thing in [9, 41 ,12 , 3 , 74, 15] :
   zork = zork + `
   print(zork, thing)
pint('after', zork)

*Summing in a Loop 
To add up a value we envounter in a loop, we introduce a sum variable that start at 0 and we add the value to the sum each time though the loop 
  
   Example
zork = 0 
print('before', zork)
for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   zork = zork + thing
   print(zork, thing)
print('after', zork)

*Finding the Average in a Loop
An average just combines the counting and sum patterns and divides when the loop is done.
  Example 
count = 0 
sum = 0 
print('before', count, sum)
for value in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   count = count + 1
   sum = sum + value
   print(count, sum, value)
print('after', count, sum, sum/count)

*Filtering in a Loop
we use an if statement in the loop to catch / filter the values we are looking for 
  Example 
print('before')
for value in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   if value > 20:
       print('Large number ', value)
print('after')

*Search using a Boolean variable
if we just want to search and know if a value was found, we use a variable that strts at False and is set to True as soon as we find what we are looking for                    
   Example
found = false
print('before', found)
for value in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
    if value == 3 :
       found = true 
    print(found, value)
print('after', found)

*How to find the smallest values
We still have a variable that is the smallest so far. The first time thought the loop smallest is None, so we take the first value to be the smallest. 

   Example
smallest = None
print('Before')
for value in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   if smallest is None :
        smallest = value
   elif value < smallest :
        smallest = value
   print(smallest, value)
print('after', smallest)

* The "is" and "is not" Operators 
-Python has an is operator that can be used in a logical experessions
-Implies " is the same as" 
-Similar to ,but stronger than ==
-is not also is logical operator

* "is" ask are the value equale in type and value
*== ask are the value equale in value  
   Example 
  0 == 0.0   this is true --->both value is equal
  0 is 0.0   this is falue --->even if they are equal in value they are ont in type

                  Charpter - 6
                    Strings 
*A string is a sequence of characters 
*A string literal uses quotes 'Hello' or "Hello"
*For strings + means "concatenate"
*when a string contains numbers, it's still a string
*We can convert numbers in a string into a number using int()

    Example
 >>>str1 = "Hello"
 >>>str2 = 'there'
 >>>bob = str1 + str2  
 >>>print(bob)    # Hello there
 >>>str3 = '123'
 >>>str3 = str3 + 1    #this will generate error typeerror: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' bojects 
 >>> x = int(str3) + 1
 >>> print(x)   #124 

Looking inside strings 
*we can get at any single character in a string using an index 
*The index value must be an integer and starts at zero
*The index value can be an expression that is computed 
   Example 
fruit = 'banana'
letter = fruit[1]
print(letter)  #a
x = 3 
w = fruite[x - 1]
print(w) #n

*A character too far 
  Example 
zot = 'abc'
print(zot[5])   #IndexError: string index out of range


*Strings have length
-The built-in function len gives us the length of a string
  Example 
fruit = 'banana'
print(len(fruit))   # 6 


*Looping through strings
-Using a while statement and an iteration variable, and the len function, we can construct a loop to look at each of the letters in a string individually
   Example
fruit = 'banana'
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
   letter = fruit[index]
   print(index, letter)
   index = index + 1

*A definite loop using a for statement is much more elegant
*The iteration variable is completely taken care of by the for loop 
  Example 
fruit = 'banana'
for letter in fruit:
  print(letter)   # b a n a n a 

*Looping and counting 
  Example 
word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word :
  if letter == 'a' :
     count = count + 1
print(count)


*Slicing Strings
-we can also look at any continuous section of a string using a colon operator
-the second number is one beyond the end of the slice 'up to but not includeding"
-if the second number is beyond the end of the string it stops at the end 
   Example 
s = 'Monty python'
print(s[0:4])    #Mont
print(s[6:7])    #p
print(s[6:20])   #python 

-if we leave off the first nmuber or the last number of the slice, it is assumed to be the beginning or end of the sting respectively 
  Example 
s = 'Monty Python'
print(s[:2])   #Mo
print(s[8:])   #thon
print(s[:])    #Monty Python

#String Concatenation
-when the  + operator is applied to strings, it means "concatenation"
  Example
a = 'Hello'
b = a + 'There'   #HelloThere
c = a + '  ' + 'There'
print(c)     #Hello There

#using in as a logical operator
-The in keyword can also be used to check to see if one string is "in" another string
-The in expression is a logical expression that returns True or False and can be used in an if statment 
     Example
fruit = 'banana
'n' in fruit   #True 
'm' in fruit   #False
'nan' in furit #True
if 'a' in fruit :
  print('Found it!')      #Found it!

#String Comparison 
   Example 
if word == 'banana':
  print('All right, bananas.')

if word < 'banana' :
   print('your word,' + word + ', comes before banana.')
elif word > 'banana':
   print('your word,' + word + ', comes after banana.')
else:
  print('All right, bananas.')

#String Liberary 
-Python has a number of string functions which are in the string library 
-These functions are already built into every string- we invoke them by appending the function to the string variable
-These functions do not modify the original string, instead they return a new string that has been altered
   Example 
greet = 'Hello Bob'
zop = greet.lower()
print(zap)   #hello bob
print(greet) #Hello Bob
print('Hi There' .lower())   #hi there 


#searching a string
-we use the find() function to search for a substring within another string 
-find() finds the first occurrence of the substing
-if the substing is ot found, find() returns -1 
-remember that string positions starts at zero
   Example 
fruit = 'banana'
pos = fruit.find('na')
print(pos)   #2
aa = fruit.find('z') 
print(aa)   #-1

#making everything UPPER CASE 
greet = 'Hello Bob'
nnn = greet.upper()
print(nnn)   #HELLO BOB
www = greet.lower()
print(www)   #hello bob


#Search and Replace
-the replace() function is like a "search and replace" operation in a word processor 
-it replaces all occurrences of the serarch sting with the replacement sring
  Example 
greet = 'Hello Bob'
nstr = greet.replace('Bob', 'Jane')
print(nstr)  Hello Jane 
nstr = greet.replace('o', 'x')
print(nstr)   #Hellx Bxb

#Stripping Whitespace
-lstrip() and rsstrip() remove whitespace at the left or right 
-strip() removes both beginning and ending whitespace

    Example
greet = '   Hello Bob  '
greet.lstrip()   #'Hello Bob   '
greet.rstrip()   #'   Hello Bob'
greet.strip()    #'Hello Bob'


#Prefixes 
   Example
line = 'Please have a nice day'
line.startwith('Please')    #True
line.startwith('p')         #False    is the line starts with small p 

#Parsing and Extracting 
  Example
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
atpos = data.find('@')
print(atpos)  #21 
sppos = data.find(' ', atpos)
print(sppos)   #31
host = data[atpos+1 : sppos]
print(host)    #uct.ac.za


#in python 3, all strings are Unicode

                                 Reading Files
    Opening File
#Before we can read the contents of the file, we must tell Python which file we are going to work with and what we will be doing with the file.
#This is done with the open() function
#open() returns a "file handle" - a variable used to perform operations on the file
#similar to "File ->open" in a word processor.
 
    Using open()
# handle = open(filename, mode)
   fhand = open('mbox.txt', 'r')
#returns a handle use to manipulate the file
#filename is a string
#mode is optional and should be 'r' if we are planning to read the file and 'w' if we are going to write to the file 

   The newline Character 
#We use a special character called the "newline" to indicate when a line ends 
    Example 
stuff = "Hello\nWorld!'
print(stuff)    # Hello 
                  World 

#We represent it as \n in strings 
#newline is still one charactr - not two 
      Example
staff = 'X\nY'
len(stuff)   #3 

#A text file has newlines at the end of each line 

  File Handle as a Sequence 
#A file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of stings where each line in the file is a string in the sequence
#We can use the for statement to iterate through a sequence 
#Remember - a sequence is an ordered set 

  Example
xfile = open('mbox.txt')
for cheese in xfile:
   print(cheese)


   Counting Line in a file 
#Open a file read-only
#use a for loop to read each line 
#Count the lines and print out the number of lines

     Example
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0 
for line in fhand:
   count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)


   Reading the *whole* file 
#We can read the whole file(newlines and all) into a single string

   Example 
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
inp = fhand.read()
print(len(inp))   #94626 
print(inp[:20])   #this will give you the first 20 character 

  Searching Through a file
#We can put an if statment in our for loop to only print lines that meet some criteria 
   
     Example
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
   if line.startswith('From:'):
      print(line)

#fixing the new line problem. 
-We can strip the whitespace from the right-hand side of the string using rstrip() form the sstring library
-The newline is considered "white space" and is stripped 
    Example 
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:') :
      print(line)

  Skipping with continue
#We can conveniently skip a line by using the continue statement 
   Example 
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From:') :
        continue
    print(line)

   Using in to select lines 
#We can look for a string anywhere in a line as our selection criteria 
    Example
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
   line = line.tstrip()
   if not 'From:' in line:
     continue
   print(line)

#prompt to enter the file name and read the file 
     Example 
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
try:
     fhand = open(fname)
except: 
     print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
     quit()
count = 0 
for line in fhand:
   if line.startswith('Subject:') :
       count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject line in ', fname)

 Python Lists 
                                   Chapter 8

# Algorithms - A set of rules or steps used to solve a problem 
# Data Structures - A particular way of organizing data in a computer 

 What is not a "Collection"
#Most of our Variables have one value in them - when we put a new value in the variable, the old value is overwritten
   
  A list is a kind of Collection
# A collection allows us to put many values in a single "variable"
# A collection is nice because we can carry all many values around in one convenient package
   Example 
  friends = [ 'Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally' ]
  carryon = [ 'socks', 'shirt', 'perfume']

   List Constants 
#List constants are surrounded by square brackets and the elements in the list are separated by commas
#A list element can be any Python object-even another list 
#A list can be empty 
     Example 
 print([1, 24, 76])   # [1, 24, 76]
 print(['red', 'yellow', 'blue'])  # ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']
 print(['red', 24, 98.6]) #['red', 24, 98.6]
 print([1, [5, 6], 71]) #[1, [5, 6], 71]
 print([])  #[]

     Example 
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
   print(i)
print('Blastoff!')    #5  4  3  2  1  Blastoff!

    Example 
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for frined in friends :
   print("Happy New Year ", friend)
print("Done")

  Looking Inside Lists
#Just like strings, we can get at any single element in a list using an index specified in square barckets 
   Example
frineds = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
print(frinends[1])   # Glenn

  Lists are Mutable(they can be changed)
#Strings are "immutable" We cannot change the contents of a string- we must make a new string to make any change
#Lists are "mutable" - we can change an element of a list using the index operator 
   Example 
fruit = 'Banana'
fruit[0] = 'b'
#this will generate error 

x = fruit.lower()
print(x)   #banana

lotto = [2, 14, 26, 41,63]
print(lotto)  # [2, 14, 26, 41,63]
lotto[2] = 28 
print(lotto)  #[2, 14, 28, 41,63]

  How Long is a List 
#The len() function takes a list as a parameter and returns the number of elements in a list 
#Actually len() tells us the number of elements of any set or sequence (such as astring...)
     Example 
greet = 'Hello Bob'
print(len(greet))  # 9 
x = [1, 2, 'joe', 99]
print(len(x))  #4


  Using the rage function
#The range function returns a list of numbers that rage from zero to one less than the parameter 
#We can construct an index loop using for and an integer iterator 
   Example 
print(rage(4))  #[0, 1, 2, 3]
friends = ['Joseph', 'Gleen', 'Sally']
print(len(frineds))  # 3 
print(rage(len(friends))))  #[0, 1, 2]


     Examples
The tale of two loops....
frineds = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']

for friend in friends :
  print('Happy New Year: ', friend)


for i in rage(len(frineds)) :      
   friend = frineds[i]
   print('Happy New Year :', frined)

   Concatenating lists using +
#we can create a new list by adding two existing lists together 
    Example 
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = a + b
print(c)    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(a)    # [1, 2, 3]


 Lists can be Sliced using : 
#Just like in strings, the second number is "up to but not includeding"

    Example 
t = [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15]
print(t[1:3])    # 41, 12 
print(t[:4])     # 9, 41, 12, 3 
print(t[3:])     #3, 74, 15
print(t[:])      #9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15

  List Methods
    Example 
x = list()
type(x)     #<type 'list'>
dir(x)      #['append', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']

  Buliding a List from Scratch
#We can create an empty list and then add elements using the append method
#The list stays in order and new elements are added at the end of the list

     Example 
stuff = list()
stuff.append('book')
stuff.append(99)
print(stuff)     #['book', 99]
stuff.append('cookie')
print(stuff)     #['book', 99, 'cookie'] 

   Is Somthing in a List?
#Python provides two operators that let you check if an item is in a list
#These are logical operators that return True of False 
#They do not modify the list 

    Example 
some = [1, 9 ,21, 10, 16]
9 in some    # True 
15 in some   #False 
20 not in some  #True

 Lists are in Order 
#A list can hold many items and keeps those items in the order until we do something to change the order 
#A list can be sorted (i.e, change it's order)
#The sort method( unlike in strings) means "sort yourself"
    Example
friends = ['Joseph', 'Gleen', 'Sally']
friends.sort()
print(friends)    # Gleenn, Joseph , Sally

  Built-in Functions and Lists 
#There are a number of Functions built into Python that take lists as patameters 
#Remember the loops we built? there are much simpler.
   Example 
nums = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]
print(len(nums))   # 6 
print(max(nums))   #74
print(min(nums))   #3
print(sum(nums))   #154
print(sum(nums)/len(nums))   #25.6 

   Two code that list values
   Example 
  #using normal way 
tatal = 0 
count = 0 
while True :
   inp = input('Enter a number: ')
   if inp == 'done' : break
   value = float(inp)
   total = total + value
   count = count + 1 
average = total / count 
print('Average: ', average)

  #using list 
numlist = list()
while True :
   inp = input('Enter a number: ')
   if inp == 'done' : break
   value = float(inp)
   numlist.append(value)    # this is where it appends all new values
average = sum(numlist) / len(numlist)
print('Average: ', average)

      #Strings and Lists
    
       Example
abc = 'With three words'
stuff = abc.split()
print(stuff)    # ['with', 'three', 'words']
print(len(stuff))  # 3 
print(stuff[0])    #With 

for w in stuff:
  print(w)    #with    three  words

#Split breaks a string into parts and produces a list of stings. We think of these as words. We can access a particular or loop though all the words.
#When you do not specigy a delimiter, multiple spaces are treated like one delimiter
#You can specify what delimiter character to use in the splitting
     Example
line = 'A lot             of spaces'
etc = line.split()  
print(etc)   #['A', 'lot', 'of', 'spaces']
line = 'first;second;third'
thing = line.split()
print(thing)    #['first;second;third']
print(len(thing))  #1
thing = line.split(';')
print(thing) #['first', 'second', 'third']
print(len(thing))  #3


   Example
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
to print the date from this email document

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand: 
  line = line.rstrip()
  if not line.startswith('From') : continue
  words = line.split()
  print(words[2])    # Sat    Fri    Fri   Fri......

#to separately print the host form the above email document detail
    Example  #this method is much more better than using find comand
words = line.split()   
email = words[1]             ---stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
pieces = email.split('@')    ---['stephen.marquard', 'uct.ac.za']
print(pieces[1])   # uct.ac.za
